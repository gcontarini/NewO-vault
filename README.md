# New Order Voting Escrow (ve) Vault System

The following contracts implement a ve-Token for the NewOrder.
They were created to replace the old staking rewards contracts, currently
being used by New Order to distribute rewards to their token holders in
favor of a system that rewards conviction.

![veNEWO System](./img/veNEWO_system_diagram.001.png "veNEWO system")

The veNEWO system allows a token holder to lock up their ERC20 tokens for a 
time period, and the token holder recieves a bonus amount of veNEWO depending
on the number of tokens and the duration for which they are locked.

The main goal is to create a ve token which works with other
reward distribution token contracts. This contract (veVault)
allows users to lock their ERC20 for a period of time. They receive
veTokens for doing so, which are not transferable.

Any number of reward distrubion contracts (Rewards.sol) can use the veNEWO held by an 
account as the basis for the rewards accrued to the account.

In general the token holder has to notify each reward contract of the
token holder's veNEWO locked balance by calling notifyDeposit() on 
each rewards contract. The UX can be simplified by using a proxy contract
and locking/notifying all in one step.

There is a variant of the rewards distribution contract for LP rewards
(LpRewards.sol) which implements special logic (see below). 
If an LP token staker has a matching amount of locked NEWO in the veNEWO 
vault to match the NEWO in the staked LP; the LpRewards vault will boost 
the LP rewards by the ve Multiplier.

The contracts are discussed in further detail, below.



# Locking & Rewards Boost

veNEWO offers a bonus depending on how long an individual account has conviction
to lock their tokens for.

The account locking tokens becomes a veNEWO Holder with their amount of veNEWO determined by the amount of veNEWO locked and the locking time period. 

The minimum time to lock is 3 months (90 days) to earn a 1.0x multiplier.

The maximum bonus of 3.3x is achieved when tokens are locked for the maximum of 3 years (1095).


Amount of veNEWO = NEWO_locked * ve_multliper(lock_time_days)
lock_time_days = x
$$ve_multliper=x^3 * 1.54143856e-09 - x^2 * 7.48615904e-07 + x * 1.16304927e-03 + 9.00265646e-01$$

Note: the amount of veNEWO remains constant until it is withdrawn rather than when it becomes unlocked.

# Tokenized Vault Standard (EIP4626)


https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626

Some donâ€™t make sense so were unimplemented.

For example, the transfer function reverts if called.

# Forced un-staking after grace period like in Convex


# Re-locking


# Comparison to other ve token systems

Rather than have ve rewards decay over time like some other ve reward models,
causing participants to have to re-lock occasionally in order to maintain 
rewards (and burn transaction fees, accordingly) we instead elect to encourage 
longer locking periods with super-linear veNEWO rewards (see figure).

# Contracts

This vault system was loosely inspired by the old StakingReward contract
by [synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix) and by other
veTokens implementations like from Curve.

# Dependencies
requires Hardhat to be installed in order to run the test suite found in /test; 
Installation instructions are found below.

# Instructions to run
First install npm dependecies
`npm install`

Create a .env file
`
echo "ETH_MAINFORK=<INSERT URL PROVIDER WITH YOUR KEYS>" >> .env
`

Install npm dependecies
```shell
npm install
```

Compile the contracts 
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Run a hardhat node
```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy the contracts
```shell
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts
```


# Deploy to eth-mainnet
Set .env file
```shell
echo "ETHEREUM_URL=<CHANGE TO YOUR PROVIDER WITH KEY>" >> .env
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=<CHANGE TO DEPLOYER PRIVATE KEY>" >> .env
```

Change the settings in scripts/ethDeploy.ts

Install npm dependecies
```shell
npm install
```

## Run the script
```shell
npx hardhat run --network ethereum scripts/ethDeploy.ts
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```
